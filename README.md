# CallAdmin  
CallAdmin is an multilingual, modular and extendable system to allow inGame reports for HL2-Games and Mods.  

The system is based on 3 parts.  
* [An extendable sourcemod-plugin](https://github.com/Impact123/CallAdmin) to report players inGame  
* An Desktopclient to notify admins  when a new report was made  
* [An webscript](https://github.com/Impact123/CallAdmin) to interact with data from the database for the client  

Please take a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Impact123/CallAdmin/wiki) for more information.

## Notes
* Currently this system is alpha software, use it on your own risk
